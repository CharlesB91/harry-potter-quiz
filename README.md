**Harry Potter Text**

- This particular highly reconsiable text is the exact same font used in the book and in the films. 
- The golden colour compliments the colour used in all the front covers of the books.
- This originally was an image taken from google however with the use of adobe illistrator i was able to trace the image and change the colour to the chosen goldenrod.
