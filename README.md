## Aim

The aim is to test the knowledge of any harry potter fan by answering a series of questions with multiple choice answers related to the film & book. This quiz is based around all ages for any occasion i.e. pub quiz or family events. 

### Business Goals

- To ultimately test a userâ€™s knowledge on the harry potter films/books. 
- To create a fun and interactive experience for the user whilst informing the user which question they are on and what their current score is.
- User will be asked a series of 5 questions. Depending on the score will depend on what house they are placed into. 
- Once completed the quiz the user will be informed which house in Hogwarts they belong with the corresponding house badge. 

### Client Goals

- This will give the user a true reflection on how well they know the films/books as well as an enjoyable experience to play with friends and family. 
- Depending on their score may tempt the user to play again. 

## Wireframing

- Initially sketched my ideas on to my note pad to try and visualise my idea. When I was happy with this I created a simulation using balsamiq for the wireframe. 
- Below are two sketches of the home screen and quiz screen.

### Harry Potter Text

- This highly recognisable text is the exact same font used in the front cover of the books and opening scene of the films. 
- The goldenrod colour compliments the colour used in all the front covers of the books.
- This originally was an image taken from google however with the use of adobe illustrator I was able to trace the image and change the colour to the chosen goldenrod for added effect.

## Design

**Colour**

- For this area I focused mainly on 2 colours
- Goldenrod - This compliments the original colour of the Harry Potter text in the front cover of the books.
- Black - This helps create a contrast between the goldenrod. 

**Font-Style**

- The particular font style "STIX Two Text" has been used as i feel this also compliments the font used in the Harry Potter Books.


## Features Left to Implement

- Additional features left which would improve the sites capabilities would be to have functionality for the user to enter their username. 
- Finally an area where the user could save their scores and have a scoreboard with highest scores for different users using a remote storage solution. 
- Instead of a question counter there would be the golden snitch moving along the screen depending on which question they are on.

### User Experience Testing

- Asked family members to review my quiz on various devices on how they found the site. This included how well they navigated and if they understood the general idea and concept. Did receive positive feedback however it was pointed out that the home and instructions button should be at top of page for easy navigation. Therefore after this feedback i implemented a nav bar. 

### Browser Testing

- This site has been testing through various popular browsers for compatibility. These include, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari

## Bugs

### Resolved Bugs

- Google Light House Error - Encountered an error with google lighthouse. There appeared to be an error with contrasting colours and foreground. After extensive uncommenting code i.e. process of elimination it was discovered that the sliding instruction bar was causing this error. Tired to change the background colour for this however was still receiving this error. For a resolution decided to create a modal box for instruction tab. Issue now resolved. 
- Release Button Issue - When a user clicked on an answer this would then lead you to the next question however this button would still have the highlighted colour effect of the hover effect on the next question. Decided in this case to remove the hover background colour on the answer buttons which resolved the issue. Researched stack overflow & google but could not find a suitable solution. 
- Background image Issue - When viewing the quiz on different screen sizes there appeared to be a lot of which space. Spoke to mentor regarding this and was suggested i could use 100vw. This still did not resolve the issues and after extensive googling I found the resolution on stack overflow. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25319124/white-space-below-background-cover-responsive).
- Quiz Timmer Issue. When the user was able to see a question and select an answer the quiz would quickly moving onto the other question before any feedback could be provided on the selected button i.e. red or green. Found a timer solution which was implemented into my js code. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17883692/how-to-set-time-delay-in-javascript).
- Favicon 404 error. When loading quiz a favicon error would appear even through no favicon icons were being used. Stack overflow suggested to use this code in each head section which seemed to resolve the issue "<link rel="shortcut icon" href="#" />"


### Un-Resolved Bugs

- No unresolved bugs however as mentioned with the Release Button Issue the only solution i could find was to remove the hover button for each answer button. 
- When loading quiz on chrome there appears to be a warning "Error with Permissions-Policy header: Unrecognized feature: 'interest-cohort'". Spoke to mentor regarding this and after some research this appears to be an chrome issue as this message is not displayed when tested on edge. This is only a warning also.
